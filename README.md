This project is my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase skills, projects, and contact information in a clean and modern layout. The website features a responsive design, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. Visitors can learn more about Azeez Yusuf in the About section, browse highlighted projects with brief descriptions and links, and easily get in touch through a simple contact form.

The site is built using HTML and CSS, with a focus on clarity and user experience. All content is easy to customize, allowing you to update your name, biography, and project details as needed. To use or modify the website, simply edit the index.html and styles.css files in your preferred code editor. Open index.html in your browser to view the site locally.

This portfolio serves as a professional online presence, helping you share your work and connect with potential collaborators or employers
